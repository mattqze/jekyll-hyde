# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is Hyde's first blog post.

Hyde is a variant of Jekyll, converted to PHP. In short, it's a non-static version of Jekyll.

## What's with the name?
In Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde after drinking a serum. Hyde reflects this, due to Jekyll being transformed into a non-static version of itself.

## Contributing
Hyde's source code is <a href='https://github.com/mattqze/jekyll-hyde'>available here</a>. You do not need to contribute, due to the code being hard to read and undocumented. If you'd like you can copy Hyde and do anything with the code. Theme conversion and bug testing is needed at the moment.
