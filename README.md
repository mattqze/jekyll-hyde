# Jekyll-Hyde
Jekyll-Hyde allows you to use the same posts as Jekyll, but non staticly. Allowing manipulation on-the-fly.

TODO-Problems:
Themes for Jekyll are not compatible with basic HTML and will need to be adapted.

URLs will be weird. They'll usea GET request to view a post due to posts.php handling both scanning and reading .md/.markdown posts.

Unnecessary features were removed. Such as RSS/XML feeds, footer-icons and the nav-bar.
