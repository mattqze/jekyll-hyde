This is a web-framework that read MarkDown, converts it to their HTML counterparts, then allows you to read them, as Jekyll does.

TODO-Problems:
Themes for Jekyll are not compatible with basic HTML and will need to be adapted.

URLs will be weird. They'll need to use a GET request or the likes to view a post due to post-manager.php handling both scanning and reading .md/.markdown posts.
